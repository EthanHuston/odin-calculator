# odin-calculator

- This is the final lesson and project in the Foundations course of The Odin Project
- It is meant to showcase all learnings from throughout this Foundations course from
HTML to CSS to Javascript, all combined.

- This is a simple calculator design, not meant to chain together operations all in one
sweep but to do individual 2 variable operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication
and division.
